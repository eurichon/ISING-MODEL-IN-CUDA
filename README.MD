<pre>
**In order to run the code you will need to have a GPU that supports cuda!
Cuda installation and setup in visual studio [Guide][2]


**About Demo:**
Concerning this section we use the previously constructed engine in cuda (v3) and the c++ library SFML
in order to visualize the results and observe the evolution process of the model.
In order to edit the Demo.cu file in visual studio and have a succesfull run you will have also to download
and link SFML [Guide][3]

**Running the Demo**
  *Press i in order to Import
  *Press b in order to Begin the updates
  *Press f in order to stop
  *Press in the window the left mouse in order to draw a red line
  *Press in the window the right mouse in order to draw a green line
  *Press esc to exit the program

**About Data:
This folder contains the multiple pre calculated states of the model in order to validate our programs.
The number declares the number of updates from the initial state <conf-init.bin>.
